To make the stand-alone Kit program without bundled data (required for Kit
Pro), follow these steps:

	make clean
	make kit_only
	
To make a kit outside of Kit Pro, you can generate the required .bin files
and they will be inserted properly during the compilation process.

        [Copy *.prc and *.pdb files into the bundles/ directory]
	[Edit the Makefile and change the Creator ID and Application Name]
	[Edit the kit.rcp file and change Creator ID, App Name, and wording]
	make clean
	make

Inside the Makefile, the target 'kit.prc' will use the bundle program
automatically.  The bundle program takes these parameters:

	./bundle [-v] <FLAGS> <File1 [File2 [...]]>
	
-v = Verbose mode (optional)

FLAGS = The integer value of the flags defined in ../common/kitdef.h
(Required)

FileX = The .prc, .pdb, or .pqa file you want bundled.  Do not include files
other than native Palm OS binaries!  Don't go including your favorite .txt
file, for instance.  If the file doesn't exist and the name starts with a
'-', the '-' will be removed and the file will be marked as an unselected
file.  This will let you define a list of files you want to install and ones
that are optional, and can be checked to install them.  See example below.
(First file is required, rest are optional)

Example:  Auto install, prompts for overwrite, prompts when done, only 1 file
    ./bundle 1 your_file.prc
    
Example:  No flags, prompts for overwrite, prompts when done, first file
is selected, second file is not selected automatically in the list.  Make
sure the second file is really named "optional.pdb" (without the hyphen).
    ./bundle 1 install.pdb -optional.pdb
