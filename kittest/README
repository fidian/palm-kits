Kittest is compiled with USE_ZLIB_STRUCT so that the gunzip source includes
SysZLib.h instead of making its own struct.  This is so that I can reuse the
ZLib struct in the decompression to compare it to the tiny inflate routines.

Inside kittest.c is the define for the number of seconds per test, and which
tests to skip.  If you skip both tests, then there is a loop test where
inflate is called three times.  This works great for profiling on POSE.
