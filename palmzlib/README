These are the include files from palmzlib in order to compile programs to
use the library.  If palmzlib is updated, be sure to update these files as
well!

ZLib is at http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
ZLib was written by Greg Roelofs and maintained by Jean-loup Gailly
Palmzlib is a minimalists patch to ZLib to get it to compile for Palm OS
Palmzlib is at http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/
zlib ARMlet port is at http://www.copera.com/zlib-armlet/
The ARMlet runs on OS5 handhelds at a significant speed increase.  It still
runs on pre-OS5, and it is a tiny bit faster there too.
ZLib and both Palmzlibs are under the ZLib license

I use the includes from the original Palmzlib distro, but I like the library
from the ARMlet port.
