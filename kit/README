To make the stand-alone Kit program without bundled data (required for Kit
Pro), follow these steps:

	make clean
	make kit_only
	
To make a kit outside of Kit Pro, you can generate the required .bin files
and they will be inserted properly during the compilation process.

        [Copy *.prc and *.pdb files into the bundles/ directory]
	[Edit the Makefile and change the Creator ID and Application Name]
	make clean
	make

Inside the Makefile, the target 'kit.prc' will use the bundle program
automatically.  The bundle program takes these parameters:

	./bundle [-v] <FLAGS> <File1 [File2 [...]]>
	
-v = Verbose mode (optional)

FLAGS = The integer value of the flags defined in ../common/kitdef.h
(Required)

FileX = The .prc, .pdb, or .pqa file you want bundled.  Do not include files
other than native Palm OS binaries!  Don't go including your favorite .txt
file, for instance.  (First file is required, rest are optional)
